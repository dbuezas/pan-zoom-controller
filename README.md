# Vanilla JS Pan Zoom Controller for video

This was made for https://github.com/AlexxIT/WebRTC/.

This repo exists just to develop the relevant file in typescript (the WebRTC project uses js).

## To generate `zoom-controller.js``

run `npm run tsc`
copy `transpiled/zoom-controller.js` over to webrtc
